By organizing content into strict "Silos" (clusters), you create "Entity Relationships" that LLMs (Like GPT-5, Gemini, Claude) love. They understand that "BPOC.IO" is the authority on "BPO Jobs" because you cover every connected topic depth-first.

# 🤖 The "Gemini 2026" Upgrade: How to Win LLMs
*Standard SEO gets you on Page 1. GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) gets you cited in the AI answer.*

### 1. The "Data Moat" Strategy
LLMs can write generic articles. They *cannot* generate proprietary data.
*   **The Fix:** Every "Plog" post must include at least one piece of unique data (e.g., "Based on 500+ recent applications on BPOC...").
*   **Why:** AI cites sources that have unique numbers/facts.

### 2. "Direct Answer" Formatting
LLMs parse content to find direct answers.
*   **The Fix:** Start sections with direct definitions before expanding.
    *   *Query:* "How is 13th month pay computed?"
    *   *Content Start:* "13th Month Pay is computed by dividing your total basic salary earned by 12. Here is the formula..."
*   **Why:** This increases the chance of being the "featured snippet" or the direct source for the AI response.

### 3. Entity Interlinking (The Silo)
LLMs understand concepts by their relationships.
*   **The Fix:** Strict internal linking. A "Salary" article must link to specific "Job Roles" (Context) and "Company Profiles" (Examples).
*   **Why:** It teaches the AI knowledge graph that `BPOC` > `Salary` > `Call Center` are connected entities.
